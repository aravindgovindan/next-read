# [Next Book](https://next-read.netlify.app/)

A simple Vue.js web app that suggests books similar to the one you're currently reading. Simply enter the title of the book you're reading and click "Show my next read" button to get a recommendation.

This app is built by utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate the book suggestions. The app also includes a simple validation check to ensure that the user enters a book title before making the request. The app is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface and is built using Vue CLI.

This project is created by me, a language model AI designed by OpenAI.

This web app is created just using the code generated from chat.openai.com. Everything from design to deployment was done following the instructions from chatGPT. All the code including CSS was copy-pasted from the AI's responses. Github repo creation and deployment in Netlify was done using the step-by-step directions generated. The errors that had popped up were also debugged by the AI. Even the description given above was generated by it. The only line of code I wrote was the prefix for the prompt used for getting book suggestions.

Given below are the prompts I used:

- I want to build an app that suggests what book I should read next, if I input a book title I liked. I want to use Vue.js. How should I start?
- I would like to use Goodreads API. Is that free?
- Is there a free service to deploy Vue.js apps?
- I want to use Netlify. What is the best way to develop the app?
- Okay, I want to start developing now. How do I create a Vue.js boilerplate code using npm? I have node.js already installed. I want to name the app "Next Book"
- I created the boilerplate Vue code. Now I want to add a home page. The page should have a title "Next Book", an input box to enter a book title, and a submit button below. The button should have the text "Show my next read". Every element needs to be center aligned. Give me the Vue code
- Where should I put the Home.vue file?
- Should I change anything in main.js file before adding the code you gave me?
- Okay, I made these changes to main.js and added your code. Now it gives me an error "Can't resolve 'vue-router' in \<path\>"
- That fixed it. But now I'm getting the error " Component name "Home" should always be multi-word  vue/multi-word-component-names"
- I changed the component name to HomePage, and it fixed the error. The app is running but it shows the page from the boilerplate code
- Everything is working. Now I need to integrate Goodreads API. Give me the code for getting a list of suggestions from the API when we input a book title
- How do I generate the Goodreads API key? 
- I changed my mind. I want to integrate OpenAI api and use it to get a book suggestion
- How do I get the API key for this?
- What should I give for this.prompt so that it takes the book I'm reading as input and suggests a similar book?
- How do I add a method to generate the prompt and use it in submitPrompt?
- How do I change the title and icon shown in the browser tab?
- I want to create a repo in Github and push this code. Walk me through the process step-by-step
- Now I want to deploy this in Netlify. Walk me through the deployment process in Netlify step by step
- How can I move the api key to .env file in my code?
- How can I store the API key in Netlify environment variables?
- Add css and beautify the homepage
- Add some more css to the title
- Do the same with input box and button
- Add some css to the recommendation div
- I need to show an alert if the user clicks submit without entering anything in the input box. In this case, the request should not go
- But the error is not resetting when I input something and click submit. How do I fix this?
